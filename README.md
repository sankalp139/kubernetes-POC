# kubernetes-POC

This Project was created for testing different congfigurations inside a Kubernetes Cluster to run Stateful apps like MongoDb  and provide correct service for secure access along with ConfigMap and secret. We used a mongo-express server to interact with the Database and make changes, and use Ingress to provide one entry point for external access. We also tested Prometheus and Grafana during this POC to cpature metrics and monitor our cluster health.
